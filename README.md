# SQL_Library_project


## Library

This project is focused on teaching the fundamentals of SQL and relational databases (RDS) using MySQL database engine. It is a common application of RDS to a library. You can fins examples of:

- Create a Database and tables.
- Queries.
- Use and create function.
- Aggregation functions.
- Nested queries.
- Joins.
- Views.

In addition, there will be some examples of more advanced statements and tools of MySQL. Some of them are:

- Functions.
- Stored procedures.
- While and Repeat Loop.
- Transactions.
- Error handlers.

Here is a good example of the basic SQL skills needed to be a Data Analyst or Data scientist (maybe a BI). For this example the relational model would look like:

The data you can find in this project is gather and created by me using Wikipedia. However, if you want to have more registers I can recommend you the following sources:

- [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/)
- [mockaroo.com](https://mockaroo.com/)

Kaggle will provide you with many resources and open data for your projects related to this field, while Mockaroo could help you create random registers for your tables.
